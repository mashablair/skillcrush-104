			<h4 class="mariablair-advice">Daily practice and repetition are the key!</h4>

			<p class="mariablair-advice">When we learn new and challenging things, frequent practice is the key.  Small steps every day are much better than big sessions once in a while.  This is just how our brain works.  So instead of procrastinating and trying to study coding all weekend, try to study a little bit every day.  Take breaks every 30 mins, stretch, walk, eat or do something fun.</p>

			<p class="mariablair-advice">Therefore, when you feel overwhelmed or annoyed and confused, take a break or a nap!  If you feel like your brain can't process any more information, close your laptop and resume the next day, preferrably in the morning.</p>

			<p class="mariablair-advice">Everyone is different, of course, but for me it's waaaay easier to study in the morning than late at night when my brain is full of information from my busy day and I'm tired. A quick 20-min coding session before breakfast goes a long way!  This is where quality vs. quantity really makes sense.  Fresh brain is way more productive than a tired brain, so you might learn much more in 20 mins than in an hour when you're tired.</p>

			<p class="mariablair-advice">I read somewhere that successful people are both smart and persistent.  I think we all know some smart people who are not successful, and some not-so-sharp people who achieved a lot because they didn't give up.  Coding is not something we are born knowing, it's something we can learn.</p>

			<p class="mariablair-advice">What do I do when I feel stuck and overwhelmed? I remind myself that it's actually a good thing because if it was easy, everyone would be a programmer!  :)  And then I take a break and do something fun.</p>
